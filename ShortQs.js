/*
1. it is a set of math functions and numbers that you can import into jscript.

2. the reason for not having math built into jscript is to have  lighter version of it, 
that does not contain those funcrtion,thus making it ligher to use.

3. Math.radndom will produce a decimal between 0 and 1 (excluding the 1)\
4. Math.floor will bring the float down to the closes integer, Math.ceil will bring the
float to the nearest high integer, Math.trunc will make the float into an integer by cutting
off the decimals. Math.round will round to the nearest integer.

5.Math.trunct and Math.floor do not return the same values when the number domain is less than
zero.

6.% is the modulus operator, and it is useful to find the remainder, and determint the nature
of numbers (odd, even);
7. Variables declared outside of a function have a scope that is greater than the function so
to access the variable you need to call it.

8. commenting on code allows you to know what the block does without trying to figure it out.

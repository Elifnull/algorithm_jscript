/*
1. it is a set of math functions and numbers that you can import into jscript.

2. the reason for not having math built into jscript is to have  lighter version of it, 
that does not contain those funcrtion,thus making it ligher to use.

3. Math.radndom will produce a decimal between 0 and 1 (excluding the 1)\
4. Math.floor will bring the float down to the closes integer, Math.ceil will bring the
float to the nearest high integer, Math.trunc will make the float into an integer by cutting
off the decimals. Math.round will round to the nearest integer.

5.Math.trunct and Math.floor do not return the same values when the number domain is less than
zero.

6.% is the modulus operator, and it is useful to find the remainder, and determint the nature
of numbers (odd, even);
7. Variables declared outside of a function have a scope that is greater than the function so
to access the variable you need to call it.

8. commenting on code allows you to know what the block does without trying to figure it out.

/*
1. source code is the sum total of all the functions, variables, instructions, loops within a
particular appliction. the source code is the code of the program.

2. computers are smart because they are capable of doing many functions over a short period of 
time.

3.the purpose of a programming lanugage is to interface between the programmer and the computer.
it is a medium that allows the programmer to abstact out of asembly code and binary into something
more understandable. then this code is translated into binary for the computer to work it out.

4.Python, javascript, java, rust, C# these are all programming languages. there are many languages
becase each language does something useful that the others don't do.

5.a variable is a container for data. it is useful becaue it formalizes and shorthands those data.

6.one sets the value of variable and the other checks the equivilence between the two variables.

7.the difference is that one is a strick equivelence, and the other is a loose equivilence. the
strick equivilence compares values and types.

8.developer console exists in order for the developer to test out the program, and track the flow
of data.

9.a conditional statment is a true/false statment, where those are the only two options. upon a true
value the program will execute the code encapsulated within the boolean.

10.while and for loops allows us to decrease the amount of repeated code by setting the parameters
and conditions under which the code will be executed.
